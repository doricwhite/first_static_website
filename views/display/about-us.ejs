          looks for on a resume? Did you know there are “highlight” area they
          will always look at first? Did you know they can determine whether you

          resume etiquette, language, and presentation change year by year. This
          is an industry that evolves rapidly in line with technology, business

            <div class="col">
              <p><strong>Why work with Storeyline?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Because this is a people-driven industry, and it gets personal.
                Your career, sense of fulfillment, and financial security are of
                paramount importance to you and that’s why we help you create
                your own “brand” rather than a simple statement of job duties.
                Storeyline Resume’s interview process is an exclusive one-on-one
                session with one of the best in the business. It covers not only
                your work history, professional goals, and salary expectations,
                but also who you really are, your reputation, and what
                distinctive value you offer a company. A great resume is a story
                with only one character, and that story needs to be told better
                than anyone else’s. We help you stand apart rather than stand
                aside.

        <!--3.2 WHAT SETS US APART-->
        <br />
        <p><strong>What sets us apart?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some resume writers make the mistake of writing a resume as if it were
          simply a job description. To be blunt, HR Managers and Recruiters toss
          these papers into a ball and chuck them into the wastebasket. Why?
          Because you’re telling them: “I do the exact same thing every other
          applicant does.” They are not looking for redundancy; they want
          powerful, engaging, and interesting candidates that set themselves
          apart from the crowd by focusing on special skills, unusual talents,
          and documented achievements. By demonstrating success rather than
          inferring it, our product becomes a must-have tool in your job search
          arsenal. Our entire process is geared to capture your personal magic
          and put it to paper. Each of you has standout qualities, no matter
          your field of employment or how long you’ve been working within it.
          We’ll help you uncover them, and in the process, help you understand
          your true value to an employer.
        </p>

        <p>
          More and more recruiters rely on ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) to
          filter out candidates long before their resumes are seen by a real
          human being. It’s critical to solicit resume writing services from a
          company well-versed in the software’s functions and how to take
          advantage of them. Storeyline Resumes understands exactly how to
          insert special keywords and phrases designed to circumvent this
          auto-rejection system without compromising the resume’s impact or
          quality.
