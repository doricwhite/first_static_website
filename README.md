---

This is a sample project completed to test some the concepts and knowledge that I have learned while completing a Web Development Bootcamp course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

## Project Details

Rebuilt a static version of [Storeyline Resume](https://storeylineresumes.com/) website using the technologies listed below:

- Bootstrap v5
- Express
- Embedded JavaScript (EJS)

**N.B.**:- _A limited amount of "commits" was included in the project as I had not learned the concepts of git and github at that time_.

## How to execute the project (view website)

- Copy the repository in an empty directory on your local machine. Before doing so ensure "git" is not initialized that that directory.

  - Terminal Commands:

    - Git initialization check: `git status`
    - Copy to repository local machine: `git clone https://github.com/doricwhite/first_static_website.git`

- Check if **Node.js** is installed on your computer. You can check this by running the command `node` in the terminal window. If you note a sample message stating **"Welcome to node.js"** then it is already installed. If not, proceed to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website and download and install the version for your computer operating system.
- After completing the above steps execute the command below in terminal from the **"first_static_website"** directory located in the directory used in the first step. This will install the required packages needed for the project.

  - `npm install`

- To view website run the command `node app.js` in your terminal window. You should see a message stating **"Localhost port open successfully"** when done correctly.
- Open your web browser and paste `http://localhost:3000/display/index-v2` in the address bar. This will open the homepage of the website.
